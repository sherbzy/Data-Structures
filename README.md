This repository contains the projects from the Data Structures course at Colorado School of Mines taken in String 2020. The README in each folder contains the project requirements and other necessary information. 
Note: I lost a majority of the labs from this class when my laptop broke in the middle of the semester.


Course Description
This course has three general components:
1. Data structures
   - What they are and how (and when) to use them
   - Know how to design and program them
   - Learn about the Standard Template Library

2. C++ programming
   - Extensions to stuff you already know (from CSCI 261 or equivalent)
   - Pointers & dynamic memory management
   - Templates
   - Inheritance

3. Analysis of algorithms
   - How computer scientists measure performance
   - How to analyze performance of an algorithm
   - Performance of algorithms and data structure operations



Learning Outcomes
At the completion of the course, you will be able to:
1. Evaluate and understand the trade-offs in selecting one data structure vs. another, and employ data structures in the solution of realistic problems.
2. Understand the purpose of an abstract data type (ADT) such as a list or map. Recognize that ADTs can have different implementations.
3. Implement fundamental data structures including linked structures, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees.
4. Implement recursive subroutines to search and manipulate data structures.
5. Determine computational complexity of simple functions, including asymptotic analysis of upper and average complexity bounds, big O notation, standard complexity classes, and empirical measurements of performance.
6. Understand the behavior and computational characteristics of fundamental computing algorithms including sorting algorithms, hashing, graph representation and traversal, and binary search tree operations.
7. Implement programs using object-oriented design and object-oriented programming including encapsulation and information hiding, separation of specification and implementation; classes, subclasses, and inheritance; polymorphism; class hierarchies.
